# myapplication
This is a simple Android app made with Kotlin. It includes three screens: Signup, Login, and Welcome. The app uses Regex to validate user input like email and password. It also uses SharedPreferences to save user details locally, so the welcome screen can show the userâ€™s name after login or signup.
